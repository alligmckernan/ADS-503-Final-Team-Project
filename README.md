# 🫀 ADS 503 Final Team Project: Heart Disease Prediction

This repository contains the final project for the ADS 503 course. Our objective was to explore and compare a variety of machine learning models to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on clinical and demographic variables.

## 📁 Contents

- **`heart.csv`**  
  The dataset used throughout the project. It includes 14 clinical features (e.g., age, cholesterol, chest pain type, max heart rate) and a binary target indicating heart disease presence.

- **`ADS-503-Final-Team-Project.qmd`**  
  The full analysis and report in Quarto format. This file includes:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing  
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
  - Feature transformation  
  - Logistic regression modeling  
  - k-NN and Naive Bayes classification  
  - Model performance comparison using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC

## 🔍 Project Highlights

- Compared multiple classification models to identify the best-performing predictor of heart disease.
- Used cross-validation and multiple evaluation metrics to assess generalization performance.
- Discussed trade-offs between interpretability and accuracy.

## 📌 Objective

To develop a predictive model that could assist healthcare providers in identifying patients at risk of heart disease, while maintaining transparency and clinical relevance in model interpretation.
